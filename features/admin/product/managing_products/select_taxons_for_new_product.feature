Feature: Select taxon for a new product
    In order to specify in which taxons a product is available
    As an Administrator
    I want to be able to select taxons for a new product

    Background:
        Given the store operates on a single channel in "United States"
        And the store classifies its products as "T-Shirts", "Accessories", "Funny" and "Sad"
        And I am logged in as an administrator

    @api @ui @mink:chromedriver
    Scenario: Specifying main taxon for configurable product
        When I want to create a new configurable product
        And I specify its code as "WHISKEY_GENTLEMEN"
        And I choose main taxon "Sad"
        And I name it "Gentleman Jack" in "English (United States)" locale
        And I set its slug to "whiskey/gentleman-jack" in "English (United States)" locale
        And I add it
        Then I should be notified that it has been successfully created
        And main taxon of product "Gentleman Jack" should be "Sad"

    @ui @mink:chromedriver @no-api
    Scenario: Specifying main taxon for simple product
